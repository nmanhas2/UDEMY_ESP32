# UDEMY_ESP32

IoT project using the ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 MCU. 

This contains functionality for setting up the ESP32 as an access point to access a webpage, live OTA updates for the firmware through a webpage, WiFi connection integration leveraging FreeRTOS tasks, live local time displayed on the webpage, live temperature and humidity data from a sensor being fed to the webpage leveraging FreeRTOS tasks, AWS IoT integration to publish and receive humidity and temperature data through MQTT protocol, and much more.

This project was created while following this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/iot-application-development-with-the-esp32-using-the-esp-idf/, while using VSCode and the ESP-IDF extension.
